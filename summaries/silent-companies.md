> Insurance giant Progressive Corp. has pledged $1 million to the Equal Justice Initiative in support of the nonprofit’s efforts to end mass incarceration, excessive punishment and racial injustice, said Tricia Griffith, the company’s chief executive.

But the WSJ did not provide further information, Progressive did not tweet about the donation, and there is no press release about it. [They have tweeted about their philanthropy in the past](https://twitter.com/Progressive/status/1192426476521455616).

#### Publix Super Markets
![Publix-histogram](../figures/tweet-histograms/Publix.png)

[Their employees cannot wear "BLM" masks.](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/publix-supermarkets-won-t-allow-black-lives-matter-garb-responds-n1231278) Publix says explicitly that it is characterized as "non-Publix messaging".

#### Ford Motor
![Ford-histogram](../figures/tweet-histograms/Ford.png)
Ford did not post a press release after George Floyd's death and subsequent protests, but when [mistakenly linked](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ford-motor-company-defund-police/) to Black Lives Matter donations, Ford released a [statement](http://archive.is/RQubl), clarifying that "Ford is proud to be America’s long-time leader in producing police, emergency and first responder vehicles." [In a press release](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2019/10/18/chicago-police-pick-hometown-favorite-ford.html), Ford claims to supply two-thirds of police vehicles.

Ford released an [internal memo](https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/local/2020/07/12/employees-pressure-ford-to-stop-producing-police-vehicles/) (that was ultimately leaked) when their employees questioned Ford's relationship to police departments. The then-CEO Jim Hackett responded, “The issues plaguing police credibility have nothing to do with the vehicles they’re driving.”

#### Best Buy
![BestBuy-histogram](../figures/tweet-histograms/BestBuy.png)
Their CEO released a statement. Best Buy uses their Twitter account mostly for promotional purposes, so it isn't particularly surprising they didn't tweet about it. [BestBuy did not allow their employees to wear a "Black Lives Matter" mask.](https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/best-buy-employee-says-he-was-told-to-stay-home-or-wear-a-different-mask-after-wearing-black-lives-matter-mask/2391883/)
