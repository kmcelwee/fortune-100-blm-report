### Full "#BlackLivesMatter" History

I used Twitter's "Advanced Search" to look for instances of "#BLM", "BLM", "#BlackLivesMatter", and "Black Lives Matter" for each company's full history prior to May 25, 2020. Only [two](https://twitter.com/Google/status/614551995442143232) [tweets](https://twitter.com/Google/status/751174648855928834) from Google appeared. Granted, no strong assertions can or should be made with this result: Twitter [cautions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/tweets/search/api-reference/get-search-tweets) "the Search API is not meant to be an exhaustive source of Tweets" because they can't promise that all tweets are indexed. However, I'd argue it can still be used as a rough heuristic: The Fortune 100 was effectively silent about "Black Lives Matter" until the summer of 2020.
